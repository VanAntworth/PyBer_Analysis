# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose 
 To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a visual. We have created these visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
 
## Worked to calculate:

 Total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type.
 
  The average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type was calculated after retrieving the previous information.

 ## Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
 
 ### The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities.
 
 The average rural fare per driver is almost 3 1/2 times the average fare per urban driver

## Three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types.



## 1 Look into rural areas and see if there is low passenger demand or low driver supply.

## 2 Furthur analysis using the timestamps to determine busiest times of day and availability of drivers at those times could help find solutions for the disparities shown.

## 3 Lower fares in rural areas to boost usage.
